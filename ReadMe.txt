OVERVIEW:

This project was a part of the fulfilment for the M.S. Program. 

Cloud-based systems have to optimize the usage of resources such as bandwidth. The bandwidth usage is reduced by decreasing the cost of TRE computation and storage. PACK is a receiver based TRE system, which uses the newly received data chunks to identify the previously received data chunks. PACK protocol diminishes the cost induced by the TRE algorithm. The server status does not have to be continuously maintained when using the PACK protocol. This feature makes PACK suitable for client mobility and server migration, which creates universal calculation environments responsible for maintaining cloud elasticity.

IMPLEMENTATION:

The implementation design and details can be found in the "PACK Report_Final.pdf" file. This was implemented in JAVA.
